MySQL Connector/Python enables Python programs to access MySQL databases, using
an API that is compliant with the `Python Database API Specification v2.0
(PEP 249) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`__.








Features
--------

* `Asynchronous Connectivity <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-asyncio.html>`__
* `C-extension <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-cext.html>`__
* `Telemetry <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-opentelemetry.html>`__




Installation
------------

Connector/Python contains the Classic and X DevAPI connector APIs, which are
installed separately. Any of these can be installed from a binary
or source distribution.

Binaries are distributed in the following package formats:

* `RPM <https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/packaging_and_distributing_software/introduction-to-rpm_packaging-and-distributing-software>`__
* `WHEEL <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/package-formats/#what-is-a-wheel>`__

On the other hand, the source code is distributed as a compressed file
from which a wheel package can be built.

The recommended way to install Connector/Python is via `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`__,
which relies on WHEEL packages. For such a reason, it is the installation procedure
that is going to be described moving forward.

Please, refer to the official MySQL documentation `Connector/Python Installation
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-installation.html>`__ to
know more about installing from an RPM, or building and installing a WHEEL package from
a source distribution.

Before installing a package with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`__, it is strongly suggested
to have the most recent ``pip`` version installed on your system.
If your system already has ``pip`` installed, you might need to update it. Or you can use
the `standalone pip installer <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/>`__.





.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install mysql-connector-python





Installation Options
++++++++++++++++++++

Connector packages included in MySQL Connector/Python allow you to install
optional dependencies to unleash certain functionalities.


.. code-block:: bash

    # 3rd party packages to unleash the telemetry functionality are installed
    $ pip install mysql-connector-python[telemetry]





This installation option can be seen as a shortcut to install all the
dependencies needed by a particular feature. Mind that this is optional
and you are free to install the required dependencies by yourself.



Available options:

* dns-srv
* gssapi
* webauthn
* telemetry







Sample Code
-----------------------------------

.. code:: python

    import mysql.connector

    # Connect to server
    cnx = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="127.0.0.1",
        port=3306,
        user="mike",
        password="s3cre3t!")

    # Get a cursor
    cur = cnx.cursor()

    # Execute a query
    cur.execute("SELECT CURDATE()")

    # Fetch one result
    row = cur.fetchone()
    print("Current date is: {0}".format(row[0]))

    # Close connection
    cnx.close()







HeatWave GenAI and Machine Learning Support
-------------------------------------------

MySQL Connector/Python now includes an optional API for integrating directly with MySQL HeatWave's AI and Machine Learning capabilities. This new SDK is designed to reduce the time required to generate proofs-of-concept (POCs) by providing an intuitive Pythonic interface that automates the management of SQL tables and procedures.

The new ``mysql.ai`` module offers two primary components:

* **GenAI:** Provides implementations of LangChain's abstract ``LLM``, ``VectorStore``, and ``Embeddings`` classes (``MyLLM``, ``MyVectorStore``, ``MyEmbeddings``). This ensures full interoperability with existing LangChain pipelines, allowing developers to easily substitute existing components with HeatWave-backed versions.
* **AutoML:** Provides Scikit-Learn compatible estimators (``MyClassifier``, ``MyRegressor``, ``MyAnomalyDetector``, ``MyGenericTransformer``) that inherit from standard Scikit-Learn mixins. These components accept Pandas DataFrames and can be dropped directly into existing Scikit-Learn pipelines and grid searches.

**Note on Dependencies:** These features introduce dependencies on ``langchain``, ``pandas``, and ``scikit-learn``. To keep existing installations unchanged and the base connector lightweight, these dependencies are **not installed by default**. You must install them separately to use the ``mysql.ai`` features.

**Example: GenAI Chatbot with Memory**

This example demonstrates how to use ``MyLLM`` within a loop to create a simple chatbot that maintains conversation history.

.. code:: python

    from collections import deque
    from mysql import connector
    from mysql.ai.genai import MyLLM

    def run_chatbot(db_connection, chat_history_size=5):
        # Initialize MyLLM with the database connection
        my_llm = MyLLM(db_connection)

        # Maintain a limited history for context
        chat_history = deque(maxlen=chat_history_size)
        system_msg = "System: You are a helpful AI assistant."

        while True:
            user_input = input("\nUser: ")
            if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
                break

            # Format history and invoke the LLM
            history = [system_msg] + list(chat_history) + [f"User: {user_input}"]
            prompt = "\n".join(history)

            # Invoke HeatWave GenAI
            response = my_llm.invoke(prompt)
            print(f"Bot: {response}")

            # Update history
            chat_history.append(f"User: {user_input}")
            chat_history.append(f"Bot: {response}")

    # Usage
    with connector.connect(user='root', database='mlcorpus') as db_connection:
        run_chatbot(db_connection)

**Example: HeatWave AutoML in a Scikit-Learn Pipeline**

This example shows how to use ``MyClassifier`` as a drop-in replacement within a standard Scikit-Learn pipeline.

.. code:: python

    import pandas as pd
    from mysql import connector
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from mysql.ai.ml import MyClassifier

    # 1. Setup Data (Pandas DataFrame)
    X = pd.DataFrame([[0.5, 0.1], [1.0, 0.8], [0.1, 0.2]], columns=["feat1", "feat2"])
    y = pd.Series([0, 1, 0], name="target")

    # 2. Connect and Train
    with connector.connect(user='root', database='mlcorpus') as db_connection:
        # Initialize the HeatWave classifier
        clf = MyClassifier(db_connection)

        # Create a standard Scikit-Learn pipeline
        pipe = Pipeline([
            ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
            ("mysql_clf", clf)
        ])

        # Fit the model (automates upload and training on HeatWave)
        pipe.fit(X, y)

        # Predict
        preds = pipe.predict(X)
        print(f"Predictions: {preds}")

        # Score
        score = pipe.score(X, y)
        print(f"Accuracy: {score}")
