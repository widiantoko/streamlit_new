    Parameters
    ----------
    figure: bokeh.plotting.figure.Figure
        A Bokeh figure to plot.
    use_container_width : bool
        Whether to override the figure's native width with the width of
        the parent container. If ``use_container_width`` is ``False``,
        Streamlit sets the width of the chart to fit its contents
        according to the plotting library, up to the width of the parent
        container. If ``use_container_width`` is ``True`` (default), Streamlit
        sets the width of the figure to match the width of the parent container.
    key: str or None
        An optional key that uniquely identifies this component. If this is
        None, and the component's arguments are changed, the component will
        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.

    Example
    -------
    >>> from streamlit_bokeh import streamlit_bokeh
    >>> from bokeh.plotting import figure
    >>>
    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> y = [6, 7, 2, 4, 5]
    >>>
    >>> p = figure(title="simple line example", x_axis_label="x", y_axis_label="y")
